# Vert.x Gradle Template for Java

Template project for creating a Vert.x module with a Gradle build.

This project was forked from https://github.com/vert-x/vertx-gradle-template.

Clone this and adapt it to easily develop Vert.x modules using Gradle as your build tool.

By default this module contains a simple Java verticle which listens on the event bus and responds to `ping!`
messages with `pong!`.

See the [build script](build.gradle) for the list of useful tasks
